      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nationality: Australia<br>
      Culture: Fiji/Indian (born in Fiji)
      Year 12, Bachelor of Accounting (2 years incomplete)<br>
      SQL, Python, Power BI, Qlikview, Alteryx <br>
      I worked mostly in Finance (insurance within superannuation) and switched to Data Analytics 4 years ago.<br>
      In my one my previous roles which provided the basis for my move to data analytics was providing systems knowledge as key SME for stakeholders.<br>
      These stakeholders included IT, Finance, Accounting, Underwriting, CDM/BDMâ€™s, Project Managers and Business Analysts.<br>
      I switched easily between business and technical conversations. Being a focal point on a key project requiring the combination to contribute both aspects and collaborating with colleagues from Hong Kong, China, Singapore and New Zealand.<br>
      One of the nice perks was being to travel to Hong Kong and New Zealand on a few occasions. <br><br>
      One of my favourite hobbies is to listen to old radio shows, as I am big fan of Audible, audio books the spoken word and audio plays.<br>
      I discovered that I love radio plays and productions, so captivating as it transports you into the play, becomes "Theatre of the Mind",<br>
      Also love listening to old baseball commenteries from 50's 60's, the voice and the description of play by play is great to listen to.<br>
      My favorite type of music to listen for relaxation/mood is Gregorian Chant.
