    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Using a camera and a 2 factor authentication application we can remove the need for passwords to be used on laptops or desktop PC's. This can also be<br>
        for sensitive and secure access to physical offices and locations. By scanning a person's face and hands gestures from the nubmers 1 to 10, the camera<br>
        initiaties the greeting on start and the 2FA code is send by mobile phone. The user will then hand sign the numbers, with the face being recognised.<br>
        An AI program would match the hand gestures nubmers to the 2FA numbers thus verifying the correct access.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        One of key frustations and can be a security failure point in business is having to remember passwords and changing them. Most large business have a password
        rotation schedule of 90 days (3 months). Staff members do have tendancy to write cryptic passwords on post-it notes and place on the pc screen or inside desk draws.<br>
        Another common practice is store passwords in excel files on the desk, and use when neccessay. Organisations have multiple applications for use in daily work.<br>
        They can be up to 4 or more applications with different username and passwords,they need to reset at different times as passwords and logins do not change all the same day.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The comination of a camera and a 2 factor application removes the need for remembering passwords. The staff would joining a organisation and complete the on-boarding process.
        Part of this on-boarding would be to stand-in front of a camera and hand gesture the numbers 1-10, this will then be uploaded on the user's laptop or desktop. The user would then start the laptop
        and the camera will initiate the welcome and the 2 factor number will be generated on the mobile phone application. The user will then gesture the displayed 2FA to the camera, this will feed into
        an application that will validate the user's face and the hand gestures numbers from the 2FA. The 2FA will also be connected the application to confirm that this is the right set of numbers.
        2FA applications change the token approximately 20-30 seconds. When a user walks away from the laptop or desktop they are required to lock the machine to ensure security so this should not present too much issue for the user to follow the new login process. This now could be applied to all the other applications without the need for having having multiple username's and passwords.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Camera's are found on most modern laptops and small camera's can be placed on the top of the screen display screen or a suitable position on the desk. A 2fa application from a reputable vendor
        i.e. Microsoft, Symantec, Authy. An AI program which learn and store the user's hand gesture number and face recognise the verified user.
      </p>
      <h2>Skills Required</h2>
      <p>
        An AI developer to program and code the learning of hand gestures, an application develope to intergrate the 2FA program and developer the inital software the login program.
        Developing single sign on validation across multiple application which the user has been granted access to and intergrating to the new program.
      </p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        This will lead to the elimination of passwords and remembering to change to different combination,which users are required to do. This will also assist users
        as when changing passwords, most applications require a significantly different password to the prior password or not to repeat any of the last the 3 passwords.
