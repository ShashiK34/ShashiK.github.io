    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

    <h2>Gaming and Modding</h2>
    <p>
      My true love for technology comes from gaming and modding games. I have been playing PC games as kind and still do.<br>
      I prefer PC games rather than console based games.   I love modding games and tinkering with the base files to change the aspects of game play.<br>
      This includes updating stats, moving elements around, and changing the unitâ€™s hierarchy. My favourite PC game types are long form games rather than the <br>
      fast paced action based, these are the Football Manger series, Medivial Total War series, X3 and Red Dead Redemption 2.

    <h2> Why RMIT?</h2>
    <p>
      I researched courses available via OUA and review some of the learning outcomes and units taught over the 3 years. RMIT had the best courses for IT.<br>
      The focus on the teaching/units were around excellent academic topics with strong industry knowledge. RMIT has an excellent world class reputation and <br>
      really excited being part of the RMIT learning program.

    <h2> Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      Wanting to get solid foundation in IT by completing the degree  to progress in my current role or embark on a new field of IT. I am really looking to researching new technology and reading articles on the latest emerging technologies, whether they were sucessful or not. Currently in my job role I work mostly with databases and data tools, but I would love to learn how to build hardware i.e. building and designing IT products.Like a small garage workshop to tinker and experiment.
